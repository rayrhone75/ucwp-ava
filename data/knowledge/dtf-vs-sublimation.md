# DTF Printing vs Sublimation

## What is DTF Printing?
DTF (Direct-to-Film) printing is a transfer method where designs are printed onto a special PET film using water-based pigment inks, then coated with hot-melt adhesive powder, and heat-pressed onto garments. DTF works on virtually any fabric type and color.

## What is Sublimation?
Sublimation printing uses heat to transfer dye directly into polyester fabrics. The dye turns into gas and bonds with the polyester fibers. It only works on white or very light-colored polyester garments.

## Key Differences

### Fabric Compatibility
- **DTF**: Works on cotton, polyester, blends, nylon, leather, denim — almost any fabric
- **Sublimation**: Only works on polyester or poly-coated substrates

### Garment Color
- **DTF**: Works on any garment color including black and dark colors
- **Sublimation**: Only works on white or very light colors

### Feel & Durability
- **DTF**: Produces a thin, flexible film layer on top of the fabric. Lasts 50+ washes with proper care
- **Sublimation**: Becomes part of the fabric with zero hand-feel. Extremely durable

### Cost
- **DTF**: More cost-effective for small orders and mixed fabric types
- **Sublimation**: Better for large volume polyester-only orders

### Color Vibrancy
- **DTF**: Excellent color reproduction with CMYK + white ink
- **Sublimation**: Exceptionally vibrant colors, especially on white polyester

## When to Choose DTF
- Printing on cotton or dark garments
- Small to medium order quantities
- Mixed fabric orders
- When you need versatility

## When to Choose Sublimation
- High-volume polyester orders
- White or light garments only
- When zero hand-feel is critical
- All-over print designs
