# Turnaround Times & Shipping

## Production Time
- **Standard**: 2-3 business days from order confirmation
- **Rush**: 1 business day (subject to availability)
- Orders placed before 12 PM EST on business days begin production the same day
- Orders placed after 12 PM EST begin production the next business day

## Business Days
- Monday through Friday
- Excludes federal holidays
- Weekend orders are queued for Monday production

## Shipping Options
| Method | Estimated Transit | Cost |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| USPS Ground Advantage | 3-5 business days | Calculated at checkout |
| USPS Priority Mail | 2-3 business days | Calculated at checkout |
| USPS Priority Express | 1-2 business days | Calculated at checkout |

Shipping costs are calculated based on package weight and destination.

## Total Delivery Estimate
Total delivery time = Production time + Shipping transit time

**Example**: Standard production (3 days) + Priority Mail (3 days) = approximately 6 business days from order to delivery.

## Rush Orders
- Rush processing is available for an additional fee
- Rush orders jump to the front of the production queue
- Rush does NOT affect shipping speed — expedited shipping must be selected separately

## Order Tracking
- Tracking numbers are provided via email once your order ships
- Track your order on our website under Account → My Orders
- Tracking updates may take 24 hours to appear after label creation

## Large Orders
- Orders over 50 sheets may require additional production time
- We will contact you if your order requires extended production
- Bulk orders can be discussed for custom timelines

## Holiday Season
During peak holiday season (November-December), production times may extend by 1-2 additional business days. We recommend ordering early during this period.
