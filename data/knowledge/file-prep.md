# File Preparation Guide

## Accepted File Formats
- **PNG** (recommended) — supports transparency
- **TIFF** — high quality, supports transparency
- **JPEG** — acceptable but no transparency support
- **WebP** — supported

## Resolution Requirements
- **Minimum**: 150 DPI at print size
- **Recommended**: 300 DPI at print size for the sharpest results
- **Maximum file size**: 15 MB per image

## Transparency
- **PNG with transparent background is strongly recommended** for DTF printing
- DTF transfers use white ink under colors — transparent backgrounds ensure only your design gets the white ink base
- If your image has a white background instead of transparent, the entire rectangle will print including the white area
- Use image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva) to remove backgrounds before uploading

## Color Mode
- **RGB color mode** is preferred for uploads
- Our system handles CMYK conversion during production
- Avoid uploading CMYK files as colors may shift unexpectedly

## Design Tips
- **Keep text large enough** — minimum 8pt font at print size for readability
- **Add a small margin** around your design to prevent edge cutting issues
- **Avoid very thin lines** — lines under 1pt may not transfer cleanly
- **Mirror/flip is NOT needed** — our system handles mirroring automatically
- **No bleed needed** — designs are cut to contour

## Image Size Guidelines
| Transfer Size | Minimum Resolution |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 3" x 3" | 900 x 900 px |
| 5" x 5" | 1500 x 1500 px |
| 10" x 10" | 3000 x 3000 px |
| 12" x 12" | 3600 x 3600 px |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Uploading low-resolution images from social media (72 DPI)
2. Leaving white backgrounds on designs intended for dark garments
3. Using extremely thin fonts or hairline strokes
4. Submitting CMYK TIFFs that look different when converted to RGB
5. Uploading screenshots instead of original design files

## Need Help?
Use our built-in preflight checker to analyze your image before uploading. It will check resolution, transparency, and format automatically.
