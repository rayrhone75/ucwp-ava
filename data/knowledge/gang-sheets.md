# Gang Sheets — How They Work

## What is a Gang Sheet?
A gang sheet is a single large print sheet where multiple designs are arranged together to maximize print area and reduce costs. Instead of printing each design individually, you pack as many designs as possible onto one sheet.

## How Gang Sheets Save Money
- You pay per sheet size, not per design
- Fit multiple different designs on one sheet
- Fit multiple copies of the same design on one sheet
- Reduce waste by filling empty space with smaller designs

## Our Gang Sheet Sizes
| Sheet Size | Width | Length | Best For |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Small | 22" | 12" | 1-4 small designs |
| Medium | 22" | 24" | 5-10 designs or larger prints |
| Large | 22" | 36" | 10-20 designs or XL prints |
| XL | 22" | 48" | Bulk orders, maximum value |

All sheets are 22 inches wide. Length varies by tier.

## Using the Gang Sheet Builder
1. **Select your sheet size** based on how many designs you need
2. **Upload your designs** — drag and drop PNG files
3. **Arrange designs** on the canvas — drag, resize, rotate
4. **Fill the space** — pack designs efficiently to maximize value
5. **Review and checkout** — the system shows exactly what will print

## Tips for Maximum Value
- **Rotate designs** to fit more in tight spaces
- **Mix sizes** — fill gaps between large designs with smaller ones
- **Use the entire sheet** — empty space is wasted money
- **Plan ahead** — if you have designs for multiple projects, combine them on one sheet

## Minimum Spacing
Designs should have at least 0.25" (quarter inch) spacing between them. Our builder tool enforces this automatically.

## Print Quality
All gang sheet prints are produced at 300 DPI using CMYK + white ink process. White ink is printed as a base layer under colors for opacity on dark garments.

## After Printing
Gang sheet transfers arrive as a single sheet. You cut out individual designs and heat-press them onto your garments. Each design is pre-cut with a contour outline for easy separation.

## Pricing
Gang sheet pricing is based on sheet size only — not the number of designs. A sheet with 1 design costs the same as a sheet with 20 designs of the same size. This makes gang sheets extremely cost-effective for multiple design orders.
