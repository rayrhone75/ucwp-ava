# Refund & Return Policy

## Quality Guarantee
We stand behind our print quality. If your order has a production defect, we will reprint it or issue a full refund at no additional cost.

## Eligible for Refund/Reprint
- **Print defects**: color shifts, missing areas, ink smearing, or adhesion failure
- **Damaged in transit**: torn, creased, or water-damaged transfers
- **Wrong order**: you received transfers that don't match your approved design

## NOT Eligible for Refund
- **Customer design errors**: low-resolution images, wrong colors in uploaded files, incorrect sizing chosen by customer
- **Applied transfers**: once a transfer has been heat-pressed onto a garment, it cannot be returned
- **Change of mind**: orders cannot be cancelled once production has begun
- **File issues flagged by preflight**: if our system warned about image quality and you chose to proceed
